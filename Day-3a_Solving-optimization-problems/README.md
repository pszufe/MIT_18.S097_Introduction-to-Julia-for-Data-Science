In this tutorial we will show how to run optimization models in Julia using JuMP.jl ecosystem. Julia provides a rich, easy to use and very powerful set of packages including for linear programming (LP), mixed-integer linear programing (MILP), nonlinear programming (MI)NLP and quadratic programming (QP) optimization problems. The JuMP.jl platform provides a single Julia-based domain specific mathematical programming language that supports over 40 solvers including all commercial and major Open Source packages as well as solvers written directly in Julia.
